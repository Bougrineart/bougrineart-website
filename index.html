            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
                I am <strong>Anas Bougrine</strong>, a German artist with great attention to detail and a passion for creative processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                My artistic journey began about seven years ago with simple pencil drawings during my school years.  
                However, it was only later, through the encouragement of friends and family who asked me for portraits, that I realized my art had an impact on others.  
                With this support, I started to evolve and increasingly experimented with acrylic and oil paints.
            </p>
            <p>
                My style is flexible — I paint what inspires me and let myself be guided by new techniques and concepts.  
                However, one thing remains constant: my preference for works with rich backgrounds and intricate details that tell a story.
            </p>
            <p>
                With my art, I want to show that great results are often the outcome of a long, patient process—a mosaic of many small details.  
                This philosophy can also be applied to life: patience, optimism, and trust in the journey can lead to unexpected success.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although art remains a hobby for me, I see it as an ambassador of my ideology. 
                My goal is to touch people with my work and offer them a new perspective on the beauty and depth of life.  
                With each piece, I hope to enrich the world, even if just a little.
            </p>

                        I place great importance on the quality of my materials. My painting mediums, especially those for oil painting,
                        are made from natural substances, as conventional products are often harmful to health or even carcinogenic.  
                        It is important to me to work as cleanly and sustainably as possible to protect the environment, myself, and my clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each of my paintings is the result of careful planning and dedication. 
                        On average, I invest between 20 and 80 hours into each piece, adjusting details until they perfectly fit the overall composition.  
                        I never rush the process because every detail matters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To give my paintings a unique touch, I often hide small Easter eggs. 
                        These add a personal character to my works and invite the viewer to discover the hidden details.
